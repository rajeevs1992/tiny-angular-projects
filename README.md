# EMI Calculator

This applications allows you to plan your war agaist loans and the accompanying EMIs.

## How is this application different?

There are a lot of EMI calculators available online. The following features make this 
application standout from the rest

### Editable EMIs 

You can edit the EMI to a number you wish to pay and see what difference it makes on the loan. This feature helps you to factor in known extra payments that you could make into the loan, like a part of fixed yearly bonus.

### Loan summary

Your loan gets summarised in a next widget that is always shown, in a way that you don't have to scroll to see the result of an update to EMI. The summary shows you the updated tenure, total interest paid and the total amount paid.

### Responsive design

In an almost fully mobile world, it makes sense to work on making the site fully usable on mobile devices as well
