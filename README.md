# Tiny Angular Projects

Project to hold tiny projects that do not deserve a repository on their own but still does accomplish something meaningful. This project intends to cut down the proliferation of repositories due these tiny projects.

## How to use this repository?

This repository makes the intended goals possible by using individual branches for each project. The master branch holds the initial angular cli project, and should be branched to create a new project.
